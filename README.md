## Build Notes

I am building a self-sourced Voron 2.4r2 300mm.

This project started as a 2.4 (r1) build in October 2021 with PIF parts from Ellis.

Voron 2.4 r2 was released in early 2022 and at the time I had only acquired the frame and Raspberry Pi since receiving my PIF parts, so I opted to go with r2 release. Due to changes between r1 and r2 versions, I had to source additional parts to accommodate the MGN12 rail and my choice to go straight to the StealthBurner tool-head. Additional printed parts for the r2 upgrade were sourced from [Simon3DPrints](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Simon3DPrints?ref=simple-shop-header-name&listing_id=1226037013).

To reduce wiring, I plan on using a CAN bus system, senseless x and y homing, and Klicky PCB probe.
