## Build 

I am building a self-sourced Voron 2.4r2 300mm.

This project started as a 2.4 (r1) build in October of 2021 with PIF parts from Ellis.

Voron 2.4 r2 was released in early 2022 at the time I had only acquired the frame and Raspberry Pi since recieving the PIF parts, so I opted to go with r2 release.

To reduce wiring, I plan on using a CANbus system, sensorless x and y homing, and klicky PCB probe.
